# Single Pulse Detection and Classification

This repository contains two key components for detecting and classifying single pulses in radio astronomy data:

1. **`DM_time_dataset_creator/`**: A module for generating DM-Time datasets from transient candidate data.
2. **`single_pulse_classifier_training/`**: Tools and scripts for training machine learning models to classify single-pulse candidates.
3. **`pipeline_classifier/`**: A high-performance pipeline for processing pulsar data and identifying single-pulse candidates.
