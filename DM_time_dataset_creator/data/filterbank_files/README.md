  The central frequency of the observed bandwidth.
- **Bandwidth**: **320 MHz**  
  Spread of the observed frequency range across 256 channels.
- **Sampling Time (`tsamp`)**: **102.4 microseconds**  
  Temporal resolution of the recorded data.
- **Start Time (`tstart`)**: **59000.48386574074 (MJD)**  
  Corresponding to **2020-05-31T11:36:46.000 UTC**.
- **Channels**: **256**  
  The number of frequency bins into which the observed bandwidth is divided.
- **Data Format**: **8-bit unsigned integers (`uint8`)**  
  Encodes signal intensity values.
- **Observation Length**: ~22 minutes
